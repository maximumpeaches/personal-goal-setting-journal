An important part of life is scheduling and prioritizing tasks. The intention with this journal is to help me do that.

# Goal setting

Suffering was useful this past weekend because I realized I need to meditate in order not to suffer any more. Turns out, I am frustrated when I don't meditate on the four immeasurables. I don't get depressed, or terribly unhappy. I get frustrated, irritable. Annoyed at life and people around me. Over a short period of time it's tolerable, but to be that way the rest of my life is unacceptable.

I'd like to set some goals besides my main task at work. Like looking into a new technology, or watching a course on Grow, or reaching out to a mentor for some advice. Maybe I set aside X time to work on my main tasks, and Y time to work on something for my personal development? I remember Uncle Bob advises this.

I need to talk with my girlfriend about how we spend time together. I would do anything for her - it's hard to reconcile this with the need to take care of myself or work on my other goals.

# Check-ins

I've maintained my calorie count the past couple days.

I meditated for 45 minutes today (so far).
